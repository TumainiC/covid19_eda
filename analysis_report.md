
# COVID-19 Research Data Analysis Report

## Overview
This analysis explored 1,056,157 COVID-19 research papers from the CORD-19 dataset.

## Key Findings

### Publication Trends
- Date range: 1856.0 - 2024.0
- Peak publication years likely during 2020-2021 (COVID-19 pandemic period)

### Journal Analysis
- Number of unique journals: 54,994
- Diverse publication sources indicating widespread research interest

### Content Analysis
- Average title length: 99.1 characters
- Average abstract length: 164.7 words

### Technical Implementation
- Data cleaning: Removed papers without titles, filled missing values
- Feature engineering: Created publication year, title length, abstract word count
- Visualization: Time series, bar charts, word frequency analysis
- Interactive app: Streamlit application with filters and visualizations

## Challenges Encountered
1. Large dataset size (>50MB) required careful memory management
2. Missing data in key fields required strategic handling
3. Date parsing required error handling for inconsistent formats
4. Text analysis needed stop word filtering and cleaning

## Learning Outcomes
- Pandas data manipulation and cleaning techniques
- Matplotlib and Seaborn visualization creation
- Streamlit application development
- Large dataset handling strategies
- Text processing and word frequency analysis

## Files Created
- covid19_data_analysis.ipynb: Main analysis notebook
- streamlit_app.py: Interactive web application
- covid19_cleaned_sample.csv: Sample of cleaned data

## Next Steps
1. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
2. Explore additional text analysis (sentiment, topic modeling)
3. Analyze author networks and collaboration patterns
4. Compare COVID-19 research with other disease research patterns
